<p align="center"><strong>Easy breezy LaTeX:</strong> A tool to monitor and build LaTeX projects, powered by Docker.</p>

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Monitors source files and rebuilds the project automatically.
- Supports various LaTeX engines (e.g., `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, `lualatex`).
- Keeps your project directory clean with configurable output paths.

## üìã Usage

To start monitoring and building a LaTeX project, run:

```bash
localleaf project_dir/ -m project_dir/main_document.tex
```

If in doubt check the `-h`elp.

<!-- help start -->

```console
$ localleaf -h
Selected container engine: podman
Easy breezy latex.

Spins up a latex docker image, monitors source files and builds on change.

  -h                          Show this message and exit.
  -m MAIN_DOCUMENT            The main document of the latex project.
